                |Global amphibian decline has been linked to the spread of a fungal disease, leading to an ongoing extinction crisis. 
                |The connection that scientists have drawn between host-disease interactions and climate has been recently featured in 
                |a number of popular press articles for students such as #[a( href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/07/160707171954.htm' target="_blank") Science Daily], #[a( href='https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/05/amphibians-decline-frogs-chytrid-fungi-bd-animals-science/' target="_blank") National Geographic], and #[a( href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-killing-bd-chytrid-fungus-death-toll?utm_source=&utm_medium=&utm_campaign=' target="_blank") Science News]. 
                |Dr. Cori Richards-Zawacki and her lab at the University of Pittsburgh have been studying this problem, 
                |and together with Pitt Bio Outreach, developed curriculum for grades 6-9 called Ectotherm ER: Frogs Under the Weather.
                |This module is used to foster awareness of the scientific method, climate change, and citizen science through learning 
                |about climate change impacts on organisms and their ecosystems. Students collect temperature data from agar frogs placed 
                |in a variety of environments and conduct their own analyses. The data the students collect can be submitted here for the 
                |Richards-Zawacki lab to utilize to predict frog disease susceptibility.

                |and then select “Manage”. There you will see the link to submit your data. 
                |You can then upload your data in spreadsheet format for the lab to use.

                |Student data is being used by the Richards-Zawacki lab at the University of Pittsburgh to ground-truth predictions of frog disease susceptibility in space and time.
                |For example, in the map seen here, warm colors denote areas where survival of northern cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) infected with Bd is predicted to be low.
                |These model predictions are generated by applying mathematical functions to computer calculations of frog body temperature. 
                |The point-estimates of agar model frog temperatures provided by students help to ensure that our computer models are estimating body temperatures correctly across a wide range of dates, 
                |times, locations, and environmental conditions.
